Rules of Hangman:

#1. Guess the letter:The player first guesses a letter.
#2.Correct guess: if the guessed word is in the word,all occurrences of that letter are revealed in their correct positions.For example:lets say the word is "computer" and the guess is"o".the display changes to "_ o _ _ _ _ _ _".
#3.Incorrect guess:If the guessed letter is not in the word, it counts as a wrong guess. A part of the hangman figure is drawn .
#4.Revealed Letters: Letters that have already been guessed, whether correct or incorrect, should be displayed so the player does not guess them again.
#5.Repeat: The process repeats until the word is fully guessed or the maximum number of incorrect guesses is reached.

Conditions to end the game:

#1.Winning the Game: The guessing player wins if they correctly identify all the letters in the word before the maximum number of incorrect guesses is reached.
#2.Losing the Game: The guessing player loses if they reach the maximum number of incorrect guesses before guessing the entire word. The hangman figure is fully drawn at this point, typically consisting of:
 *Head
 *Body
 *2Hands
